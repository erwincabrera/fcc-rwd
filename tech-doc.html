        We can compare procedural (functional) decomposition and object-oriented decomposition using the classic
        example of implementing operations for a small expression language. In functional programming, we typically
        break programs down into functions that perform some operation. In OOP, we typically break programs
        down into classes that give behavior to some kind of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We show that the two approaches largely lay out the same ideas in exactly opposite ways, and which way
        is “better” is either a matter of taste or depends on how software might be changed or extended in the
        future. We then consider how both approaches deal with operations over multiple arguments, which in many
        object-oriented languages requires a technique called <em>double (multiple) dispatch</em> in order to stick with
        an object-oriented style.

        <h1>The Basic Set-Up</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        The following problem is the canonical example of a common programming pattern, and, not coincidentally,
        is a problem we have already considered a couple times in the course. Suppose we have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Expressions for a small “language” such as for arithmetic
        </li>
        <li>
          Different <em>variants</em> of expressions, such as integer values, negation expressions, and addition
          expressions
        </li>
        <li>
          Different <em>operations</em> over expressions, such as evaluating them, converting them to strings, or
          determining if
          they contain the constant zero in them
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This problem leads to a conceptual <em>matrix</em> (two-dimensional grid) with one entry for each combination of
        variant and operation:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>&nbsp;</th>
          <th>eval</th>
          <th>toString</th>
          <th>hasZero</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Int</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Add</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Negate</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        No matter what programming language you use or how you approach solving this programming problem,
        you need to indicate what the proper behavior is for each entry in the grid. Certain approaches or languages
        might make it easier to specify defaults, but you are still deciding something for every entry.

        <h2>The Functional Approach</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        In functional languages, the standard style is to do the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Deﬁne a <em>datatype</em> for expressions, with one <em>constructor</em> for each variant. (In a dynamically
          typed language, we might not give the datatype a name in our program, but we are still thinking in terms of
          the concept. Similarly, in a language without direct support for constructors, we might use something
          like lists, but we are still thinking in terms of deﬁning a way to construct each variant of data.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Deﬁne a <em>function</em> for each operation.
        </li>
        <li>
          In each function, have a branch (e.g., via pattern-matching) for each variant of data. If there is a
          default for many variants, we can use something like a wildcard pattern to avoid enumerating all the
          branches.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note this approach is really just procedural decomposition: breaking the problem down into procedures
        corresponding to each operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ML code shows the approach for our example: Notice how we deﬁne all the kinds of data in one place
        and then the nine entries in the table are implemented “by column” with one function for each column:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          exception BadResult of string
			   
          datatype exp =
             Int of int
             | Negate of exp
             | Add of exp * exp
                    
          fun eval e =
              case e of
                  Int _ => e
                | Negate e1 => (case eval e1 of
                                    Int i => Int (~i)
                                  | _ => raise BadResult "non-int in negation")
                | Add(e1,e2) => (case (eval e1, eval e2) of
                                    (Int i, Int j) => Int (i+j)
                                  | _ => raise BadResult "non-ints in addition")
                  
          fun toString e =
              case e of
                  Int i => Int.toString i
                | Negate e1 => "-(" ^ (toString e1) ^ ")"
                | Add(e1,e2) => "(" ^ (toString e1) ^ " + " ^ (toString e2) ^ ")"
                            
          fun hasZero e =
              case e of
                  Int i => i=0
                | Negate e1 => hasZero e1
                | Add(e1,e2) => (hasZero e1) orelse (hasZero e2)

        <h2>
          The Object-Oriented Approach
        </h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        In object-oriented languages, the standard style is to do the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Deﬁne a <em>class</em> for expressions, with one <em>abstract method</em> for each operation. (In a
          dynamically typed language, we might not actually list the abstract methods in our program, but we are still
          thinking in terms of the concept. Similarly, in a language with duck typing, we might not actually use a
          superclass, but we are still thinking in terms of deﬁning what operations we need to support.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Deﬁne a <em>subclass</em> for each variant of data.
        </li>
        <li>
          In each subclass, have a method deﬁnition for each operation. If there is a default for many variants,
          we can use a method deﬁnition in the superclass so that via inheritance we can avoid enumerating all
          the branches.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note this approach is a data-oriented decomposition: breaking the problem down into classes corresponding
        to each data variant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is the Ruby code, which for clarity has the different kinds of expressions subclass the <code>Exp</code>
        class. In a statically typed language, this would be required and the superclass would have to declare the
        methods that every subclass of <code>Exp</code> deﬁnes — listing all the operations in one place. Notice how we
        deﬁne the nine entries in the table “by row” with one class for each row.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          class Exp
          # could put default implementations or helper methods here
          end
          
          class Int < Exp
            attr_reader :i
            def initialize i
              @i = i
            end
            def eval
              self
            end
            def toString
              @i.to_s
            end
            def hasZero
              i==0
            end
          end
          
          class Negate < Exp
            attr_reader :e
            def initialize e
              @e = e
            end
            def eval
              Int.new(-e.eval.i) # error if e.eval has no i method (not an Int)
            end
            def toString
              "-(" + e.toString + ")"
            end

              @e2 = e2

              Int.new(e1.eval.i + e2.eval.i) # error if e1.eval or e2.eval have no i method

            end
            def hasZero

          The Punch-Line
        </h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        So we have seen that functional decomposition breaks programs down into functions that perform some
        operation and object-oriented decomposition breaks programs down into classes that give behavior to some
        kind of data. These are so exactly opposite that they are the same — just deciding whether to lay out our
        program “by column” or “by row.” Understanding this symmetry is invaluable in conceptualizing software
        or deciding how to decompose a problem. Moreover, various software tools and IDEs can help you view a
        program in a different way than the source code is decomposed. For example, a tool for an OOP language
        that shows you all methods <code>foo</code> that override some superclass’ <code>foo</code> is showing you a
        column even though the code is organized by rows.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, which is better? It is often a matter of personal preference whether it seems “more natural” to lay out
        the concepts by row or by column, so you are entitled to your opinion. What opinion is most common can
        depend on what the software is about. For our expression problem, the functional approach is probably
        more popular: it is “more natural” to have the cases for <code>eval</code> together rather than the operations
        for <code>Negate</code> together. For problems like implementing graphical user interfaces, the object-oriented
        approach is probably more popular: it is “more natural” to have the operations for a kind of data (like a
        <code>MenuBar</code>) together (such as <code>backgroundColor</code>, <code>height</code>, and
        <code>doIfMouseIsClicked</code> rather than have the cases for <code>doIfMouseIsClicked</code> together (for
        <code>MenuBar</code>, <code>TextBox</code>, <code>SliderBar</code>, etc.). The choice can also depend on what
        programming language you are using, how useful libraries are organized, etc.
